[Only for Linux]

Very simple python program developed by:
Github -> Kuch72
Discord -> Kuch!#0001

Installation:

`` git clone https://github.com/Kuch72/DDoS_API/ ``

`` cd DDoS_API.py ``

`` python3 DDoS_API.py ``

You only need to have an API for sending HTTP requests and replacing it on the print of the line 64!

You are free to add functions to this program and I will be happy to see them.

The reselling of this code is prohibited as it is an open source program.

For any issue with it contact me via discord: Kuch!#0001
